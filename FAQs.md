<!--- <h4>Do you own either of these lenses?</h4>

No. I used to own a 28mm, but it fell into the sea a few years back (itâ€™s yours, if you can find it; itâ€™s down there somewhere, about a mile off the coast of Ireland ðŸ˜‰). I didnâ€™t keep note of the serial number, unfortunately, so it isnâ€™t included in the list (so, if you do dive down and grab it, be sure to send me the details ðŸ˜‰).

<h4>Why did you start this project?</h4>

When looking for another copy, I relised just how uncommon they were; I was also surprised by the lack of historical data. The 28mm has an excellent reputation, so this humble project was born. During my research, I also came across the 20mm (which seems to be even scarcer!), so I included this one as well.

<h4>How can I contribute?</h4>

If you'd like to submit the details of any identified lenses, please include links to photos that clearly show the mount type and serial number.

I'm also on the lookout for any further information about Nissin Koki Co. Ltd. Please provide links to references that support any contributed information. 

<h4>Why don't you refetence your sources?</h4>

They have a very annoying habit of disappearing! Most of the info I've found has been gathered from online retail sites, and the listings are shortly  discarded as soon as the sales complete. -->
