<h3>Project FAQs</h3>

*** THIS DOCUMENT IS (STILL) A WORK IN PROGRESS ***

<h4>I would like to add a lens to the database. What do you need?</h4>

In short, as much information as you're willing and able to share; however, please consider the following as an absolute minimum requirement:

- a photo of the front of the lens that clearly displays the full description and serial number engraved on the faceplate
- a photo of the rear of the lens that clearly evidences the mount type

<h4>Why are there so few links to original sources?</h4>

Many of the sources are auction and sale listings, and they tend to disapear once the lenses move on. In an ideal world, everything would be archived; however, one has to be considerate of data use and copyright restrictions. As a next-best alternative, I try to present the important stuff using detailed and accurate summaries (doing so takes time, though, so I throw myself down on your patience).

<h4>Fair enough, but why are there no photos?</h4>

If I had the opportunity to take some, I would; I don't own any of the lenses listed here, and I've never had physical access to them. I don't use anyone else's photos because I obviously don't own the copyright.
