   The objective of <b>The Promura Project</b> is to collate as much information as possible about two very obscure and rare camera lenses: the <b>Auto-Promura 28mm C.P. Hi-Lux MC</b> and the <b>Auto-Promura 20mm C.P. Hi-Lux MC</b>. Please visit the <a href="https://github.com/martbetz/The-Promura-Project/tree/main">Github repo</a>.

---

<h4>Why did you start this project?</h4>

For a few different reasons:

- the Auto-Promura 28mm C.P. Hi-Lux MC appears to have earned an excellent reputation
- the lens is very rare
- no one seems to know much about the lens or the manufacturer
- while researching the Auto-Promura 28mm C.P. Hi-Lux MC, I stumbled upon the Auto-Promura 20mm C.P. Hi-Lux MC 
- apparently, I've too much time on my hands

<h4>Where can I find reviews of these lenses?</h4>

There are some helpful [Auto-Promura 28mm C.P. Hi-Lux MC reviews on pentaxforums.com](https://www.pentaxforums.com/userreviews/auto-promura-28mm-2-8-c-p-hi-lux-mc.html). As for the Auto-Promura 28mm C.P. Hi-Lux MC, this thing is so rare that I've yet to find any — _please get in touch if you know of some!_

<h4>I would like to add a lens to the database. What do you need?</h4>

In short, as much information as you're willing and able to share; however, please consider the following as an absolute minimum requirement:

- a photo of the front of the lens that clearly displays the full description and serial number engraved on the faceplate
- a photo of the rear of the lens that clearly evidences the mount type

<h4>That lens looks exactly like my Spiratone/Soligor/Sears! Can I send you the details?</h4>

You can, but I won't be using them without supporting evidence — my friend's sister's husband looks exactly  like Elvis, but he won't be moving into Graceland any time soon.

<h4>Why are there no links to some of the original sources?</h4>

Many of the sources are auction and sale listings, and they often tend to disapear once the lenses move on. In an ideal world, everything would be archived; however, one has to be considerate of data use and copyright restrictions. Having said all this, I still record the important stuff within the detailed summaries (doing so takes time, though, so I throw myself down on your patience).

<h4>Fair enough, but why are there no photos?</h4>

If I had the opportunity to take some, I would; I don't own any of the lenses listed here, and I've never had physical access to them. I don't use anyone else's photos because I obviously don't own the copyright.

<h4>What's with the "Lacale/Location?"</h4>

Where possible, I try to include the last known location of all lenses (usually gathered from auction details or the address of the seller). Once the lenses change hands, and if they pop up for sale in the future, I'll update the history accordingly.
